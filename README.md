# My Windows nvim config.

**Notes...*
* I am not proficient in Lua so my init is in vimscript.
* Currently COC is having trouble with anything typescript/javascript.

# Themes of choice

**Daytime...**
* I like to run either rose pine dawn or github light for colorscheme
* Both with the github light airline theme.

**Night...**
* I like to run either Tokyonight, rose pine, or one dark.
* For airline during the night each theme comes with their own Airline theme. Rose pine may be the only one that doesnt and if so I believe I run github dark.
